‚öôÔ∏è Project Process ‚Äì
Data Extraction: Retrieved structured data from a MySQL database including customers, transactions, and date tables.
Data Cleaning (Excel): Removed duplicates, handled null values, and filtered out irrelevant columns.
Currency Conversion: Created a new column (norm_amount) to normalize sales amounts by converting USD to INR.
Data Modeling (Power BI): Built relationships between tables and created calculated fields for analysis.
Dashboard Creation: Designed interactive dashboards for revenue, sales trends, top customers, and products.
Interactivity & Filtering: Added slicers, filters, and drill-downs for enhanced user experience and insights.

‚úÖ Conclusion
In this project, I successfully built a Sales Insights Dashboard using Power BI and Excel based on SQL database tables. The entire process simulated a real-world BI workflow‚Äîstarting from raw SQL data, cleaning in Excel, modeling in Power BI, and finally visualizing in meaningful dashboards. This helped derive actionable insights such as top customers, monthly trends, and product performance.
